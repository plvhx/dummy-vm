```
dummy VM implementation to execute common arithmetic instruction (+, -, *, /).
this is just for learning purpose, you find it useful or not, i don't care.

testing for memory leak:
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./<executable-binary> 2>&1

PS: see main.c (for hex string to bytecode representation)
